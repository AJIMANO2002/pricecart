Summary of Session
1. props
     Props are arguments passed to react components.
     Props are Read Only
2. props drilling
    Props drilling are passing props from Parrent component to Deeply Nested Child component through coponents that don't use the props.
    It causes Unwanted re-renders for the component those who don't even use the props themselves.
    Impact the performance due to too many re-renders
    It affects the readability of code.
    props drilling can be resolved by using statemanagement hooks like useContext() or by using State management frameworks like Redux and these will be covered later
3. useState()
    It helps in handling the state of the application data.
    If we use normal variable will be updated but DOM will not be updated. Hence in order to update the UI/DOM we need state management. And useState does this job.
  useState fn will give 2 values
      stateValue
      stateFunction
   stateValue can be updated only with the help of stateFunction
   Every state update will re-render the components.
